story:
  p1: "Kampong Trach, about 40km from downtown Kampot, was once one of the most famous areas in Kampot Province. Its dramatic limestone cliffs and the area's natural beauty led to the development of a bustling trade center during French colonization. And then, in the late 1960s, the Khmer Rouge came....."
  p2: "The American bombings soon followed. The area was devastated. Our peaceful countryside became a war zone. The dramatic limestone cliffs and caves, once popular tourist attractions, became hiding places for villagers, like my family. I was born here in the 1980s, during the civil war. We lived under the Khmer Rouge until they finally surrendered in 1995."
  p3: "Today, development is slow, but the land is healing. The caves and shrines now stand as memorials. The rice fields are alive with buffalo, and the lakes  we were forced to build under The Khmer Rouge now reflect the natural beauty of this place."
  p4: "I’d love to show you Kampong Trach: an authentic side of rural Cambodia and, in my view, one of the most beautiful areas in the province. A place only now being re-discovered by tourism."
