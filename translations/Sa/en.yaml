faqs:
  - q: "How do I book?"
    a: >
      Message me on WhatsApp, Telegram, or Call using the buttons below. Tell me your
      date, group size, and which tour you’d like. I’ll reply quickly to confirm
      availability, share the pick-up time, and send a short confirmation so you
      know you’re set.
  - q: "Where do you pick up?"
    a: >
      I provide pick-up and drop-off at your hotel in Kampot. When you book, please
      include your hotel name (or a map link). I’ll confirm the exact time and meeting
      point in the booking chat.

      Bring sunblock, a hat, swimwear (for kayaking/waterfall), and comfortable

      if you plan to swim. I provide water and fresh fruit.
